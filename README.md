# Patient Record Data Analysis Dashboard

## Project Overview:
This project involved developing an interactive dashboard to analyze patient data from a healthcare facility. The dashboard was designed using Python, Power BI, DAX, and Excel, providing both desktop and mobile views for ease of access and navigation.

## Key Features:
- **Patients by Diseases**: Categorized patients based on different diseases, allowing healthcare professionals to track the prevalence of various conditions across the population.
- **Patients by District & Place**: Analyzed patient demographics by district and place, providing insights into geographical patterns and enabling targeted healthcare strategies.
- **OP and IP Visits by Month & Year**: Visualized outpatient (OP) and inpatient (IP) visits over time, categorized by month and year, to identify trends in healthcare utilization and seasonal variations in patient inflow.
- **Visits by Departments**: Monitored patient visits across different departments, helping management assess department workloads and optimize resource allocation.
- **Patient Demographics (Male/Female)**: Segmented patients based on gender, providing gender-based insights into healthcare needs and treatment outcomes.
- **Doctor Analysis by Patient Visits**: Analyzed the number of patients visited by each doctor, categorized by diseases, enabling performance evaluation and resource planning for the healthcare team.

## Tools and Technologies Used:
- **Python**: Used for data cleaning and preprocessing, employing libraries like Pandas and Matplotlib for initial analysis and visualization.
- **Power BI**: Created interactive visualizations and dashboards, making it easy for users to explore patient data.
- **DAX**: Implemented dynamic calculations and measures in Power BI to provide real-time insights and actionable data.
- **Excel**: Assisted with initial data organization, ensuring smooth integration into the Power BI dashboard.

## Interactive Dashboard Views:
- **Desktop View**: Provides a comprehensive overview of all analysis sections, allowing for deep dives into specific metrics such as disease categories, geographic trends, and department visits.
- **Mobile View**: A streamlined version of the dashboard optimized for mobile devices, ensuring quick access to key data on-the-go.

## Conclusion:
This project demonstrates my ability to handle large datasets, conduct in-depth analyses, and create dynamic, user-friendly dashboards using a combination of Python, Power BI, DAX, and Excel. The dashboard not only provides critical insights for healthcare management but also enables data-driven decision-making at multiple levels.
